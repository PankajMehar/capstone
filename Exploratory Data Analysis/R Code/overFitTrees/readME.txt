treesR.R: The end of this file contains our 3 trees. To create these trees, we randeomly sampled 1,236 rows from the non-claim part of the data set. The reason is because we don't get any splits when we use all of the data

subAllFeatTreeFull.png: In the subsetted data, using all the risk features, thisshows the full tree

subNoATree.png: In the subsetted data, using all the risk features except Accidents, this shows the full tree

subNoVTree.png: In the subsetted data, using all the risk features except Violations, this shows the full tree

extraStuff.R: DOES NOT RUN. Just a bunch of misc code.
